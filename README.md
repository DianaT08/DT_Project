#**Description of the project** 

This is a project created for the Data Transmission subject at TUC-N.  
The purpose of this project is to create an app that serves as a blog site for programming tutorials.  
The app was fully implemented in Javascript (both the server and client side). As for data storage, we created our database in MySQL Workbench.
